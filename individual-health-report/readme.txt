Someone asked me to craft individual reports from a bunch of excel files with health data of over 300+ people.
This directory contains the code, as well as sample inout and output files. Some of the data is in Persian language which was a first for me in python.
identifying columns of the files are anonymized for data privacy.

1401.xslx is the data for the current year (1401 in Persian calendar, equivalent to 2022-2023)
sample-for-one.xlsx is a file containing the data for one individual from previous years which are used to make the comparison plots.
*.png are gradient images for the repective metrics with green for natural range, yellow for warning ranges and red for dangerous ranges.
X Yagut.ttf is the persian font used for labels and header lines.
sample-output.pdf is a sample output.
